# Electric-Vehicle-Tableau-Project

About this project
The dashboard focuses on various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into the adoption and growth of electric vehicles, specifically Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Problem Statement: 
The aim was to understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, assess the market's size and growth, and analyze the technological advancements and market shares of BEVs and PHEVs. This information is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the EV market.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Vehicles:
Assess the market size and growth by understanding the overall landscape of electric vehicles, including both BEVs and PHEVs.

Average Electric Range:
Gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of EVs by determining the average electric range of the vehicles in the dataset.

Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
Analyze the total number of BEVs and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of EVs to understand the dominance of fully electric models.

Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
Analyze the total number of PHEVs and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of EVs to understand the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

Project Highlights:

*Developed a comprehensive and interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize and analyze the electric vehicles market.
*Enabled stakeholders to understand market trends, technological advancements, and consumer preferences.
*Provided actionable insights through detailed KPIs and visualizations to support strategic decision-making.
